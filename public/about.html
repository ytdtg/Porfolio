<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I like playing video games such as Grand Summoners and Magic Chess: Go Go because they require strategic thinking, planning, and decision-making. These games allow me to build and manage teams, experiment with different combinations, and adapt my strategies based on each situation. Playing them helps improve my problem-solving skills and patience while also providing entertainment and relaxation.
